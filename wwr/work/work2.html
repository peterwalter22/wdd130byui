        <p>Friends are the family you choose</p>
        <p>Blessed are they who have the gift of making friends, for it is one of Gods greatest gifts. It involves many
            things, but above all the power of going out of ones self and appreciating what is noble and loving in
            another.</p>

            <li>Friends should be like books, few, but hand-selected.</li>
            <li>You've got a friend in me.</li>
            <li>Friends are the siblings God never gave us</li>

        </blockquote>
        <p>Reagan and Peter</p>
        <p>I wasn't expecting you. I didn't think that we would end up together. The single most extraordinary thing I've ever done with my life is fall in love with you. I've never been seen so completely, loved so passionately and protected so fiercely</p>
        <p>Two are better than one. â€”Ecclesiastes 4:9</p>
