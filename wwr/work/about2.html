        <p>Hi, Our names are Reagan and Peter. Peter is originally from Nigeria in west of Africa but has lived in new
            York for 2 years while Reagan is from Colorado but has moved around the states and outside the state.
            This is how we met. From the moment our eyes met that beautiful Wednesday afternoon at the BYUI MC, my world
            shifted.
            Amidst the hum of chatter and clinking dishes, there was a serenity in your presence that captured my heart
            entirely.
            Your smile, Your dimples and your beautiful face as radiant as the sun filtering through the windows, warmed
            my soul and
            drew me irresistibly toward you.
            You are my every dream come true, the enchanting melody that plays softly in my heart. Your laughter is the
            sweetest symphony, In you, I've found my forever, my perfect
            companion, my one true friend.
            Every day since that fateful afternoon, my friendship grows deep with you. You are my joy, my strength,
            and my inspiration. With you, life is a beautiful adventure, and every moment spent together is a cherished
            memory. I am endlessly grateful for the day our paths crossed, and I promise to be your friend with all that
            I am, forever
            and always.</p>
